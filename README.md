# AI & ML Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning fundamentals.

It contains small, focused projects implemented to understand core concepts such as:
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Basic Natural Language Processing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Training and evaluating simple ML models

These projects are academic and learning-oriented. External references were used for understanding concepts, and the implementations are well understood and explainable.

I plan to continuously extend this repository as I learn more advanced techniques.

## Projects Included

- Maze Solver using BFS and DFS
- Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- nltk

This repository reflects learning progress, not production-ready systems.
