# AI & ML Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning fundamentals.

It contains small, focused projects created to understand core concepts such as:
- Search algorithms
- Supervised machine learning
- Regression models
- Natural Language Processing basics

The projects are academic and learning-oriented. External references were used to understand concepts, and the implementations are well understood and explainable.

## Projects Included

### 1. Maze Solver
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Grid-based maze representation
- Path reconstruction using parent tracking

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report

### 3. Regression Models
- House price prediction using a real-world dataset
- Comparison of Linear Regression, SVR, and Random Forest
- Student performance prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Purpose

This repository reflects continuous learning and practice of AI and ML concepts, starting from fundamentals and gradually progressing toward more advanced topics.
