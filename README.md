# Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates multiple linear regression using a small, synthetic dataset related to student performance.

The objective is to understand how multiple features together influence a target variable.

## Dataset

- Manually created dataset
- Features:
  - Hours studied
  - Attendance percentage
  - Assignment score
- Target:
  - Final student score

This dataset is intentionally simple and is used for learning purposes.

## Approach

1. Create a structured dataset using pandas
2. Inspect dataset information and check for missing values
3. Select multiple input features and a target variable
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Multiple Linear Regression model
6. Make predictions on test data
7. Evaluate model performance

## Model Used

- Multiple Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Visualization

- Scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted student scores

## Files

- `student_performance.py` — Implementation of dataset creation, model training, prediction, and evaluation

## Purpose

This project was created to understand the concept of multiple linear regression and how multiple input variables affect predictions.
