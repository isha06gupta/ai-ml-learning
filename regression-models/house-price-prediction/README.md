\# House Price Prediction using Regression Models



This project implements a basic house price prediction pipeline using the California Housing dataset.



The goal of the project is to understand how different regression models perform on the same dataset and to compare their results.



\## Dataset



\- California Housing dataset (from scikit-learn)

\- Contains information such as median income, house age, population, and other regional features

\- Target variable: Median house value



\## Approach



1\. Load and explore the dataset

2\. Check for missing values

3\. Perform basic exploratory analysis (correlation heatmap)

4\. Select features and target variable

5\. Split data into training and testing sets

6\. Train multiple regression models

7\. Evaluate and compare model performance



\## Models Used



\- Linear Regression

\- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

\- Random Forest Regression



\## Evaluation Metrics



\- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

\- R² Score



These metrics are used to compare how well each model predicts house prices.



\## Visualizations



\- Correlation heatmap

\- Residual plot for error analysis

\- Regression line visualization for Linear Regression



\## Files



\- `house\_price\_prediction.py` — Complete implementation of data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization



\## Purpose



This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand regression models, model comparison, and evaluation techniques on a real-world dataset.
